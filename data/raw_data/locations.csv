<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally owned by the Borough of Scarborough, the mainland at the base of the bluffs was transferred to the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority in May 1960 as part of the Waterfront Plan for Metro. The park was developed in two stages by the Authority. The first phase that satisfied a need for public open space, was officially completed and opened in 1975 at a cost of $2.2 million. Phase two, developed for $6.0 million and completed in the early 1980's, provided public launching facilities for recreational boaters and sailors, as well as open space for private yacht clubs. A total of 2.6 million cubic metres of lakefill was used at Bluffer's Park.</p>"

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thomas McDonald West, owner and operator of J. &amp; J. Taylor Limited, Toronto Safe Works purchased the 16.2 hectare Rumph farm overlooking the Scarborough Bluffs in 1904-1905. He and his wife, Emma, then divided it among their four children, Joseph McDonald, William Needham, Howard Thomas, and Rosetta. Many of the historic landscape improvements enjoyed today were initially undertaken by Rosetta's husband, Robert Watson McClain, and her brother Joseph McDonald.</p>
<p>Rosetta McClain died in December 1940, and in 1959 her husband donated their property (about four hectares) to the city of Toronto in her memory. In 1977, this land was conveyed to the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority and combined with portions of the J.M. and H.T. West properties. A further parcel from the W.N. West holdings was added in 1985, creating a 7.5-hectare park. The shell of an old pine house reminds park visitors that people once farmed this property with the spectacular view of the Scarborough Bluffs.</p>"

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The park was named after the Christie Sand Pits, which were on the location until the early 1900s. The sand pits had been named after Christie Street, and the street had been named after William Mellis Christie. Christie was the co-founder of the Christie &amp; Brown Cookie Company which is now known simply as Mr. Christie.</p>
<p>On April 4, 2017, Toronto and East York Community Council adopted the naming of the artificial ice rink in Christie Pits as the Sid Smith Artificial Ice Rink.  Sidney James Smith was born July 11, 1925 in Toronto.  As a youngster, he practiced on the ice rink in Christie Pits every chance he could.  This is where his love for hockey began.  He played in minor leagues in Toronto and later with the Oshawa Generals in the Ontario Hockey League. Sid Smith played his entire NHL career as a left-winger with the Toronto Maple Leafs from approximately 1946 to 1958.  He was team captain from 1955 to 1956.  Sid Smith played in seven All-Star Games and won three Stanley Cups, the John B. Sollenberger Trophy and two Lady Byng Memorial Trophies.</p>"

<strong>History and Ecological Restoration</strong><br>
Historically, Nordheimer Ravine was the home of Castlefrank Brook, which ran southeast, down through Rosedale Valley and eventually into the Don River. In the mid-1970s the stream was buried when the Spadina subway line was built. Even though the original creek now flows inside a storm sewer there are still many places along the valley slope where ground water seepage causes wet pockets to appear at the surface. This feature is one of the reasons why Nordheimer Ravine has been the focus of several ecological restoration projects.<br><br>

Restoration efforts began in 1997 when ponds were created by the City of Toronto to collect water in some of the wetter sites within Nordheimer Ravine. Over the years volunteers have helped to plant trees, shrubs and many native terrestrial and aquatic herbaceous plants. Ongoing work by the City of Toronto, as well as volunteer stewards, has helped keep non-native invasive species at bay and allowed native species to flourish. The ravine has become a popular stopping point for many birds and other wildlife."

The space has been a public park since 1980, before which it sat vacant or served as a parking lot. Over the last few years, the City of Toronto has been working closely with the local community to plan the revitalization of the well-used and well-worn park.<br><br>


Berczy Park is named after William Berczy, a German-born architect, surveyor, and writer often considered a co-founder of modern Toronto with John Graves Simcoe. Berczy was also a painter, most famous for his portrait of Mohawk chief Thayendanegea (Joseph Brant).<br><br>

<strong>About the revitalization</strong><br>
Park and street construction began in 2015 by Somerville Construction of Toronto. The design was completed by celebrated landscape architects Claude Cormier + Associés of Montreal. The park includes a wider, central plaza with granite mosaic paving, wider sidewalks along Front Street and Scott Street, grassy berms and garden beds. A mix of new tree species was planted in state-of-the-art Silva Cell growing chambers.<br><br>

The park's historic centrepiece, a large fountain, has been replaced by a new two-tiered fountain with a unique and whimsical theme. With its opening in spring 2017, 27 dog sculptures – and one cat – are situated around, in, and on the fountain, each spraying water from its mouth. A golden bone sits atop the fountain.<br><br>

A public artwork, commissioned by the City's Economic Development and Culture Division following a public competition, will be installed on the west side. Toronto artist Luis Jacob's piece is called Jacob's Ladder.<br><br>

Park revitalization also included the reconstruction of Scott Street on the western border. The new street features curbless borders and pavers that integrate with the park design."

<h2>History and Ecological Restoration</h2>
<p>The north side of the park was once just a grassy slope, but in 1990, the City of Toronto and the Taskforce to Bring Back the Don planted native trees and shrubs. The slope has since developed into mature maple-ash woodland. In 2002, a small marsh was added at the bottom of the slope to collect and clean stormwater and to provide habitat for native plants and animals. An eroded hillside path was replaced with a rock-lined trough that directs water to flow into the wetland area. Volunteers have helped to plant trees and shrubs in the marsh site, as well as native flowers, sedges, and rushes. A wide range of diverse habitats provides natural areas with resilience against the establishment of invasive species.</p>"

<p>The Guild Inn was built in 1914 as a white stucco, arts and crafts style mansion originally surrounded by over 400 acres of gardens and woodlands. The residence was built for Colonel Harold C. Bickford, a decorated war hero. When Rosa Breithaupt Hewetson purchased the property in 1932, shortly before her marriage to Spencer Clark, the socially conscious couple decided to model their new property into the Canadian equivalent of Roycroft in East Aurora, New York, considered to be the centre of the Arts and Craft movement at the time. The site provided a home and a forum for artists and artisans, where their work was created and collected for the enjoyment of many. Many of the artists were contemporaries or students of members of the Group of Seven, and the influence can be seen in the work they produced.</p>

<p>During the Second World War, the Canadian Government requisitioned the property and turned it into a training base for the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRENS). The hotel also served as a military hospital for victims of shellshock, with the craft facilities providing therapeutic rehabilitation for the service personnel undergoing treatment there.</p>

<p>The Clarks returned to the property in 1947. For the next 35 years, the Clarks built a reputation as patrons of the arts and preservationists, amassing a huge art collection and preserving architectural fragments from dozens of demolished buildings. The property and the architectural fragments were sold to the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority in 1978 to be maintained as a public park. Spencer Clark continued to run the hotel until 1983, when a Board of Management was formed to oversee operations. At the time of the City's amalgamation, the Board was disbanded and the City’s Economic Development and Culture Division took over responsibility for the sculpture and architectural fragments, while the Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division began to manage the surrounding parkland. The hotel continued to operate under contract management until it closed in 2002 when it was considered no longer viable without a major capital infusion.</p>

<p>It is the City of Toronto’s vision that through a private/public partnership, the site can be redeveloped and the arts activity can once again flourish.</p>"

Toronto-born Carnegie, one of the first black hockey players in the semi-pros, saw his ambition to play in the National Hockey League thwarted on account of existing racial barriers of that era.

<strong>History and Ecological Restoration</strong><br>
What is now the Humber Bay Butterfly Habitat was once a barren piece of land created by the deposition of lakefill by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) at the mouth of Mimico Creek. The newness of this area provided an opportunity for naturalization in an area experiencing urbanization, and through inter-agency, federal, provincial and volunteer efforts the land was transformed into habitat for butterflies and other wildlife. The area is now comprised of many different plant communities, including wildflower meadow, short grass prairie, woodland, and wetland.<br><br>

The Humber Bay Butterfly Habitat opened in 2002 and a key component of the success of the project was the involvement of volunteer stewards. Dedicated volunteers have played a very large role in restoration efforts through planting native wildflowers, shrubs, trees, grasses and sedges, as well as removing invasive species and monitoring the plant and wildlife communities in the park."

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The magnificent view of the bluffs from Scarborough Heights Park is the reason this significant geological feature is called the Scarborough Bluffs. When Elizabeth Simcoe, the wife of Upper Canada's first Lieutenant-Governor, saw the beautifully carved sandstone cliffs in 1793, she considered building a summer residence on top and naming it Scarborough for the Yorkshire town of Scarborough, in England, that is also known for its cliffs. In the same year, Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe renamed the township Scarborough, as tribute to the Duke of York. When the township was originally surveyed in 1791 by Augustus Jones, it was called Glasgow. </p>

<p>In 1920, the Scarborough Water Works System was constructed here. As Scarborough grew in population, the capacity of the filtration plant and pumping station were expanded; by 1952, the filtration plant processed 14.0 million gallons of water per day. Today, only the pumping station and the reservoir are still in use. </p>

<p>In May 1960, the Borough of Scarborough transferred its Scarborough Bluff holdings to the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority. Various parcels of land were combined as part of the Waterfront Plan, a program designed to promote public ownership along the bluffs as a means of curtailing further erosion.</p>"

<h2>History</h2>
<p>At one time, much of the parkland belonged to the Sisters of St. Joseph, whose property extended from Kingston Road to the lake. Much of the property was sold to Dolphin Developments who planned to develop a residential neighbourhood on the property. Permission for building the subdivision was granted on the condition that the southern section be turned into a park. Ownership of that land was transferred to the municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in January 1960.</p>"

<h2>History and Ecological Restoration</h2>
<p>From 1889 to 1989, Don Valley Brick Works Park was the site of a large-scale brick-making and distribution operation. Bricks were forged using water from Mud Creek and clay from the Brick Works quarry. The bricks made at this site are used in buildings throughout Toronto, including Casa Loma, Massey Hall, the Ontario Legislature, parts of the University of Toronto’s St. George campus, and numerous private homes.</p>

<p>In 1989, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) acquired the Don Valley Brick Works site from private development, and in 1995, the City of Toronto and TRCA began restoration work. A series of wetland environments have been constructed to provide habitats for aquatic plants and wildlife, as well as to bring water from nearby Mud Creek through the wetland to be filtered naturally before it flows into the Don River, and ultimately Lake Ontario. With the help of dedicated volunteers and strong partnerships, the City of Toronto has successfully introduced wetland, dry wildflower meadow, and forest plant communities to different parts of the Don Valley Brick Works site, creating a variety of ecosystem types.</p>"

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sylvan Park was named after the nearby Sylvan Avenue. In Roman mythology, Sylvanus was a woodland deity and Sylvan refers to the wooded rural character of the area. An earlier name for the park was the Cherry Orchard. It was purchased from private owners in 1966 by Metropolitan Toronto, the regional government at the time. Later it was transferred to the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority. The land was acquired to curtail further erosion and to prevent possible development of housing on the site.</p>

<p>The western boundary of Sylvan Park is close to Bellamy Creek where it cuts thorough the Scarbough Bluffs to Lake Ontario. The ravine surrounding Bellany Creek known as the Bellamy Ravine is also known as Gates Gully, after a well-known pioneer, Johnathan Gates who settled in the area in 1815. Gates later operated the Scarboro Inn, also known as Gates Tavern, on Kingston Road, just east of Bellamy Road.</p>

<p>More recently, the trail through Gates Gulley was named after the well-known Canadian artist Doris McCarthy, who lived at the end of Meadowcliffe Road and owned a portion of the Bellamy Ravine. Doris McCarthy, best known for her landscape paintings, lived on the picturesque 12-acre property from 1939 to her death in 2010. She referred to her home as ""Fools Paradise"" and she donated it to the Ontario Heritage Trust in 1998, hoping that other artists would use the lands on the Scarborough Bluff to inspire art after her death. She donated the lands in the ravine to the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority for conservation and access purposes. A sculpture is located at the point where the Doris McCarthy Trail meets the lakeshore.</p>"

<br><br>
<strong>Six Elements</strong><br> 
Ground Planes - The site was reformed to create a tilted plane that acknowledges two aspects: the urban side and water side. At selected viewing points, a series of tilted planes break through the surface as places for sitting and gathering. Umbrella-dotted terraces step down to the lake. In addition, a pattern of linear surface planes running east-west across the parks abstractly recall the railway tracks that fed the now-defunct industries of the area.<br><br>

Water - A series of connected water elements accentuate the theme of water returning to its source. Each element is programmed to celebrate the intrinsic qualities of water. These include motion activated sprays, steam and fog, variations in colour and coloured ice.<br><br>

Islands - The overlay of green islands provide gently sloping lawns for repose. Islands that meet residential buildings become horticultural to mediate between the public and private. The islands in the slips mediate storm water overflow. Native water’s edge species act as an urban estuary to provide a living filter for micro-organisms.<br><br>

Expressive Horticulture - The planting strategy involves three basic treatments: sloping lawns, horticultural and bio-remediation islands. Tree planting expresses a north-south gradient from a grove of multi-stem ash at the north, to wind-catching willows towards the water’s edge. Planting of horticultural islands provide interest through the year, and buffer the residential or more private areas of the park. Selected species with winter berries contribute to the idea of the site as a bird and wildlife habitat.<br><br>

Lighting - Seasonal animation, a sense of identity, playfulness and security is created through the lighting. Tall mast lights act as an ‘area moon’ and is programmed to change seasonally. Lighting transforms the dark surfaces of the water basins. The water’s edge is softly illuminated by a connective glow. The lighting is also a vehicle for creating a sense of theatre and journey on the cultural corridors that line the city to the water.<br><br>

Beach Furniture - The design calls for informal beach furniture scattered across the south end of the site, transforming it from an urban park to an urban beach.<br><br>
<strong>History</strong><br>
Over a decade ago, approximately 16 hectares (40 acres) of land within Toronto’s Harbourfront was designated for public parks, waters-edge promenade, and school/community centre users. Since that time, several of the park sites have been developed including the Toronto Music Garden.<br><br>

At the end of June 2003, Toronto City Council approved a conceptual design for Phase I of the Harbourfront Parks and Open Space System. Phase I was to focus on Maple Leaf Quay East, Maple Leaf Quay West, and their related slips. They were planned to essentially connect Harbourfront Centre with the Spadina Quay Wetland and the Toronto Music Garden.<br><br>

In July 2004, Mayor David Miller and Deputy Mayor Joe Pantalone, Chair, Harbourfront Parks Steering Committee unveiled the new location for a waterfront park, H<sub>T</sub>O.<br><br>

The winning design team for Phase I consisted of Janet Rosenberg & Associates Landscapes Architects of Toronto and Claude Cormier Architects Paysagistes Inc. of Montreal. Together they created the design known as H<sub>T</sub>O. The name represents the fundamental changes that will take place in the relationship between Toronto and the waterfront."

The park design is inspired by Bach's First Suite for Unaccompanied Cello, with each dance movement within the suite corresponding to a different section of the garden. <br><br>
Public art honouring Terry Fox was installed in the park in October 2023. <br><br>

<strong>Gardens &amp; Plant List - Bach's Suite No. 1 for Unaccompanied Cello</strong><br>

Prelude - An undulating riverscape with curves &amp; bends: The first moment of the suite imparts the feeling of a flowing river through which the visitor can stroll. Granite boulders from the southern edge of the Canadian Shield are placed to represent a stream bed with low-growing plants softening its banks. The whole is overtopped by an alley of native Hackberry trees, whose straight trunks and regular spacing suggest measures of music.<br><br>

Allemande - A forest grove of wandering trails: The Allemande is an ancient German dance. Interpreted here as a Birch forest, the movement invites the visitor to swirl inward to various contemplative sitting areas, that move higher and higher up the hillside, culminating in a rocky vantage point that looks over the harbour through a circle of Dawn Redwood trees.<br><br>

Courante - A swirling path through a wildflower meadow: Originally an Italian and French dance form, the Courante is an exuberant movement that is interpreted here as a huge, upward-spiralling swirl through a lush field of grasses and brightly-coloured perennials that attract birds and butterflies. At the top, a Maypole spins in the wind.<br><br>

Sarabande - A Conifer grove in the shape of an arc: This movement is based on an ancient Spanish dance form. Its contemplative quality is interpreted here as an inward-arcing circle that is enclosed by tall needle-leaf evergreen trees. Envisioned as a poet's corner, the garden's centerpiece is a huge stone that acts as a stage for readings, and holds a small pool with water that reflects the sky.<br><br>

Menuett - A formal flower parterre: This French dance was contemporary to Bach's time. Its formality and grace are reflected in the symmetry and geometry of this movement's design. Hand-crafted with ornamental steel, a circular pavilion is designed to shelter small musical ensembles or dance groups.<br><br>

Gigue - Giant grass steps that dance you down to the outside world: The Gigue, or ""jog"" is an English dance, whose jaunty, rollicking music is interpreted here as a series of giant grass steps that offer views onto the harbour. The steps form a curved amphitheatre that focus on a stone stage set under a weeping willow tree; a place for informal performances. Shrubs and perennials act as large, enclosing arms, framing views out onto the harbour.<br><br>

<strong>History</strong><br>

Inspired by Bach - Inspired by the pictorial element in Johann Sebastian Bach’s Suites for Unaccompanied Cello, internationally renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma collaborated with a number of artists to produce Inspired by Bach – a six part film series. The series was produced by Rhombus Media Incorporated and broadcasted in 1997 and 1998.<br><br>

For the first film in the series, The Music Garden, Mr. Ma worked with landscape designer Julie Moir Messervy to interpret in nature the music of Bach’s first suite. As a result of the film project, Yo-Yo Ma, Julie Messervy and Rhombus Media Incorporated approached the city of Boston, Massachusetts to create an actual garden based on The Music Garden. When the Boston site fell through, Toronto enthusiastically embraced the project.<br><br>

The Design - Julie Messervy designed the waterfront Music Garden in collaboration with landscape architects from the city’s Parks, Forestry and Recreation Department. The garden design interprets in nature Bach’s First Suite for Unaccompanied Cello, with each dance movement within the suite corresponding to a different section in the garden. Two Canadian artists created special features for the Music Garden. Tom Tollefson, architectural blacksmith, fabricated the Music Pavilion, and the late Anne Roberts of Feir Mill Desing Inc., designed the Maypole.<br><br>

The Donors - James Douglas Fleck led the private side of a public/private collaboration with the City of Toronto to create and build the Toronto Music Garden. The donors are David and Vivian Campbell, George and Kathy Dembroski, James and Margaret Fleck, David and Catherine Graham, Michael and Sonja Koerner, Wilmot and Judy Matthews, Jim and Sandra Pitblado and Sandra Simpson. The Weston Foundation has also contributed to the project."

<strong>Humber Bay Butterfly Habitat (HBBH) - Attractions &amp; Features</strong><br>
The goal of HBBH is to establish a self-sustaining native plant community which will support a variety of butterfly species, while engaging and educating park users about the value of urban wildlife habitat. HBBH is approximately four acres and includes the following:<br><br>

Short Grass Prairie - The short grass prairie component of the HBBH is located along the stormwater management pond at the west-end of the site. The low growing, drought tolerant vegetation characteristic of this native plant community, provides a variety of host and nectar plants for caterpillars and butterflies. Trees and shrubs have been planted on the berm opposite the prairie, to offer perching areas, shelter and further food sources.<br><br>

Wildflower Meadow - The Wildflower Meadow represents the largest component of the HBBH, and lies at the furthest east-end of the habitat. There are four vegetation communities represented in this meadow: tallgrass prairie, shortgrass prairie, wet meadow and upland meadow. Each area provides a distinct mix of native wildflowers, grasses and sedges as well as unique physical features. The area between the wildflower meadow and the lake is a large native shrub and tree bed, which provides food, shelter and a wind break for the meadow.<br><br>

Home Garden - Have you ever wondered how you can turn your garden into a haven for butterflies? The Home Garden incorporates butterfly-friendly plants and physical features that lend themselves to a backyard setting. Key features include benches, stonewalls, gravel and interlocking walkways, perennial beds with native and ornamental species, and interpretive art features."

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Hanlan family was among the first year-round inhabitants on Toronto Islands, settling at Gibraltar Point in 1862. After the islands were transferred from the federal government to the City of Toronto in 1867, Plan D-141 divided the land into lots and allowed cottages, amusement areas and resort hotels to be built. The west side of the island, commonly known as West Point, rapidly became a resort destination for the citizens of Toronto. The first summer cottage community was founded here. In 1878, a hotel was built by John Hanlan at the north-west tip of the island and soon after the area became known as Hanlan's Point.</p>
<p>There are 2.48 km from Hanlan's Point Ferry Dock to the Island Filtration Plant.</p>"
1582,2542,2542,HTO Park West,park,None,Queens Quay W & Lower Spadina Ave,None,Toronto and East York,375,None,Queens Quay,None,W,None,"A unique space that faces the inner harbour with the Toronto Islands in the distance, it's a spot to sit and relax during a busy day downtown. The urban beach is the focal point of HTO Park West. Bright yellow umbrellas populate the white sand providing shade for those relaxing in muskoka chairs. Take in the scenery or have a picnic. It's a great spot to enjoy while exploring Toronto's engaging waterfront. <br><br>
Stylized as H<sub>T</sub>O, the name is word play between the chemical element of water, H<sub>2</sub>O, and the common abbreviation for Toronto, TO.<br><br>

<strong>Six Elements</strong><br> 
Ground Planes - The site was reformed to create a tilted plane that acknowledges two aspects: the urban side and water side. At selected viewing points, a series of tilted planes break through the surface as places for sitting and gathering. Umbrella-dotted terraces step down to the lake. In addition, a pattern of linear surface planes running east-west across the parks abstractly recall the railway tracks that fed the now-defunct industries of the area.<br><br>

Water - A series of connected water elements accentuate the theme of water returning to its source. Each element is programmed to celebrate the intrinsic qualities of water. These include motion activated sprays, steam and fog, variations in colour and coloured ice.<br><br>

Islands - The overlay of green islands provide gently sloping lawns for repose. Islands that meet residential buildings become horticultural to mediate between the public and private. The islands in the slips mediate storm water overflow. Native water’s edge species act as an urban estuary to provide a living filter for micro-organisms.<br><br>

Expressive Horticulture - The planting strategy involves three basic treatments: sloping lawns, horticultural and bio-remediation islands. Tree planting expresses a north-south gradient from a grove of multi-stem ash at the north, to wind-catching willows towards the water’s edge. Planting of horticultural islands provide interest through the year, and buffer the residential or more private areas of the park. Selected species with winter berries contribute to the idea of the site as a bird and wildlife habitat.<br><br>

Lighting - Seasonal animation, a sense of identity, playfulness and security is created through the lighting. Tall mast lights act as an ‘area moon’ and is programmed to change seasonally. Lighting transforms the dark surfaces of the water basins. The water’s edge is softly illuminated by a connective glow. The lighting is also a vehicle for creating a sense of theatre and journey on the cultural corridors that line the city to the water.<br><br>

Beach Furniture - The design calls for informal beach furniture scattered across the south end of the site, transforming it from an urban park to an urban beach.<br><br>
<strong>History</strong><br>
Over a decade ago, approximately 16 hectares (40 acres) of land within Toronto’s Harbourfront was designated for public parks, waters-edge promenade, and school/community centre users. Since that time, several of the park sites have been developed including the Toronto Music Garden.<br><br>

At the end of June 2003, Toronto City Council approved a conceptual design for Phase I of the Harbourfront Parks and Open Space System. Phase I was to focus on Maple Leaf Quay East, Maple Leaf Quay West, and their related slips. They were planned to essentially connect Harbourfront Centre with the Spadina Quay Wetland and the Toronto Music Garden.<br><br>

In July 2004, Mayor David Miller and Deputy Mayor Joe Pantalone, Chair, Harbourfront Parks Steering Committee unveiled the new location for a waterfront park, H<sub>T</sub>O.<br><br>

The winning design team for Phase I consisted of Janet Rosenberg & Associates Landscapes Architects of Toronto and Claude Cormier Architects Paysagistes Inc. of Montreal. Together they created the design known as H<sub>T</sub>O. The name represents the fundamental changes that will take place in the relationship between Toronto and the waterfront."

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Centre Island is between Hanlan's Point and Ward's Island. A carriage route along the peninsula connecting the mainland to Gibraltar Point Lighthouse later evolved into Lake Shore Avenue, the main east-west axis along Centre Island. By the late 1800's, many of Toronto's wealthiest families built beautiful Victorian summer homes along Lake Shore Avenue, east from Manitou Road to Ward's Island.</p>
<p>In 1884, construction of an Anglican church, St. Andrew-by-the-Lake, was directed by Archbishop Sweatman. Four years later, Island Park was established on land previously occupied by the Mead Hotel and has continued to offer an impressive panoramic view of downtown Toronto ever since. </p>

Crother Woods is an Environmentally Significant Area due to its diverse, mature and relatively undisturbed forest, and the presence of wildflowers and tree species that are rare in the Toronto region.<br><br>
<strong>History and Ecological Restoration</strong><br>
Despite the pressures of urbanization, parts of Crothers Woods contain a great diversity of herbaceous plants and tree species, similar to what was in the area before European settlement. In 1995 the Toronto Region and Conservation Authority (TRCA) designated Crothers Woods an Environmentally Significant Area (ESA) due to its relatively undisturbed woodland habitat, and the area was adopted as an ESA in Toronto’s Official Plan in 2015. This area is home to many mature trees, including some that are over a century old, as well as some plant and animal species that are rare in the Toronto area.<br><br>

While Crothers Woods has a healthy canopy, much of the understory was lost due to past unmanaged recreational uses. The popularity of the site for recreational use poses a risk of further habitat disturbance. Environmental impacts of public use of this natural area were addressed by the City of Toronto through the Crothers Woods Trail Management Strategy. The Strategy outlines ways to restore and protect the area in order to maintain existing natural heritage features, create safe, logical, and sensitive trail systems, and improve park user safety. The City of Toronto has worked with volunteers to control invasive species, maintain trails and encourage trail users to enjoy the area responsibly."

On June 24 1944, Cole continued to perform his duties during an attack on German U-Boats in the face of intense anti-aircraft fire and engine failure. Cole was wounded by shrapnel and abandoned the aircraft in a dinghy, where he spent the next 21 hours in the water, assisting others. He was ultimately able to save the flight Navigator's life, but the pilot, David Hornell did not survive. Cole, born in 1923, lived on Lake Promenade in Long Branch. He died in 1991."
